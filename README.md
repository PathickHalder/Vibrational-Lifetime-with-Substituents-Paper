# The initial geometries of all 20 molecules of this study were optimized using MP2/6-31G(d), followed by MP2/6-31G(d,p), and finally optimized with MP2/6-31G(2df,2p). The vibrational mode frequencies and anharmonic constants of all molecules were calculated with MP2/6-31G(2df,2p) for the final geometries.

# All frequencies need to be scaled by a scaling factor of 0.9445.
